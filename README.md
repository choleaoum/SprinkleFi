## SprinkleFi - An opensource project for a WiFi controlled sprinkler system for your lawn/plant care.

This project will use an ESP32 to control a 24VAC sprinkler system. 

### Features

* Detecting weather changes using an API and powering the sprinkler on/off. (Severe heat changes/potential rain fall to save on water)
* Keep the sprinkler on a scheduler.


The PCB board is currently out for production and will be uploaded here on Git when tested/completed.
