## SprinkleFi 
An opensource project for a WiFi controlled sprinkler system for your lawn/plant care. This project will use an ESP32 to control a 24VAC sprinkler system. This will be available for everyone and please be responsible. I will take no responsibility if you hurt yourself or ruin your sprinklers.

### Features

* Detecting weather changes using an API to power the sprinkler on/off. (Severe heat changes/potential rain fall to save on water)
* Keep the sprinkler on a scheduler.
* Analytics to view your watering pattern. (TBD)
* Control different sectors.

The PCB board is currently out for production and will be uploaded here on Git when tested/completed.
